Linked Lists vs Vectors
Fast access to head and tail

Help find segfaults
    You know where segfaults happen because output doesn't produce

// New temp points to where head once pointed
// Then head now points to tmp
Draw out your pointers and link lists
    Times where you need to trace your code
    Find dangling pointers and so on
    Will be drawn in the final exam

IntNode *Curr =head;
wihle(curr != nullptr){
    cout << curr->value << ' ';
    curr = curr->next;
}
while(head){
    ElkNode *newNode = new IntNode()

    delete head
}

For PA4, just call pop_front for destructor
