D- Dependacy Inversion Principle
    Instead of depending directly on a low level module
        Depend on an abstraction
        In the case where the low level module is changed & upscaling
    Then functions who focus on a simple purpose
        Deliver just delivers, the function writer decides when to take care of paying
End of SOLID principles

Next topic is still about design
    Emergent Design
        You don't really need to design everything
            You don't require full upfront design planning

Emergent Desgin comes from education
    Within Agile, it referes to a framework that delivers functionality, letting design take form on its own
    TDD
        Eliminate redundacy
        The whole design develops from this
        Design in chunks
            Produces very small code, in small code chunks
    4 Rules of Simple Design
        Run all tests
            A system mst be verifiable
            TO verify a system, we must test it
            Knowing that we need to test the system, forces us to design classes that follow SRP
            A testable system is decoupled and follows the DIP
        Constains no duplication
            Merge functionality makes the system simpler
            Sometimes functions are similar but don't do the exacct same thing
            Especially before moving forward
            Template Method (used to remove duplication)
                Create a template that everything will inheret from
                There will be some duplication
                Ex:
                    A data miner that is written for 4 different data formats
                    If you dupe more than twice, just start rescaling the system
                        Eliminate redundacy
                    If there is something with a known sequence of steps
                        Create an abstract class, and concrete classes build from it
                        This should all be moved to the base class
                    That would be a mine() algorithm that is a set of steps
                        Every step being a repetitive function
                        Implement these pure virtual methods
                        (I think I am good and have been doing this)
                        virtual functions means you will later define them

        Express the intent of the programmer (Expressive!)
            Good naming
            Good testing
            Keep classes and functions small
            Clear interfaces
            Make your code elegant
        Minimize the number of classes and methods
            Kinda conflicting with single responsibility principle
            Basically KISS
            Minimal classes and methods
            Last rule of priority
            After you have made your code functional, try to minimize the number of classea and functions
            Small classes and small functions should not b a dogma, but do it when it makes sense
            Virtual methods bring more runtime
    Advantages of Emergent Design
        Keeps development focused on functionality
        Lack of overengineering
        Keeps discussion pragmatic and systematic
        Saves time in resources spent in designing systems
    Disadvantages
        No plan for changes which cause design to deteriorate
        No plan for growth which limit future development
        Ignores crucal dependacies which can translate in wrong implementation
        Lacks coordination which can cause development deadlocks
        Most of these problems are mitigated with clear and SOLID interface creation from the very beginning
            If you make classes open for extension, it shouldn't be too bad

Starting Strong
    Turn off implicit declarations
    Declare all variables
    Use naming convention
    Check variable names
    * Most of these are enforced by g++
        Such as avoiding implicit variables
        Along with unused variables
When to initialize variable
    Try: Try to initialize the declaration time
    Do: If you can't init at declaration, do it close to when it is used
    Better: Declare and define close to where it is used

    Window of vulnerability
        The gap between declaration and actually using it


Thursday
strong coding
Use const when possible
Reset counters and accumulators
Initialize a class's member data in its constructor

Localize Refrences to Variables
