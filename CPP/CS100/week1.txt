Make sure code works well
    No memory leaks
    good unit tests
    can't be hacked / security risk

Ideas
    Program that can grab the cheapest flight prices

    How to eat the cheapest (good) food on campus
        Include food ETA's
        include app redirects
            Include the app's benefits
        How far away you are from the campus, include if you are at a parking lot, like 50 (UV)
        Also add Big Springs parking lot feature
        All terminal based
            The back end should be what matters the most
            It should give you options of food after a questionare
            something like a preference algorithm
        If anyone is good at graphs, we should graph the campus
            Have the graph visualizer library thing

    A program that lets that gives people the most efficient seats for an airplane to board as soon as possible
        It is kinda like a game
            Names for NPCs, along with time taken to board every person
            Time taken using graphs and how long it takes for people to sit down once they get there
                Then merge conflicts
        Reason, we have a cheap airline, it is fast and efficient, and strict on time
            No reserved seating because that kills time, (time for another entire flight)
            Pure utility, but obviously there will be a first class
                (I think this algorithm already exists)
                You can choose each algorithm
