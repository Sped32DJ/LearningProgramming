Workflow techniques
Waterfall Method
    Very bad, only practical if you are perfect
Cowboy Coding
    You can only get away with this in small projects, and easy projects
Kanban (signboard in Japanese)
    For Just-in-time manufacturing developed by Toyota
    Takes into account the fact that some parts of the manufacturing process is faster than the other
    Has a WIP limit
        These parts must be done before you go onto the next
    Make sure to move at least one task to DONE per day, makes work more satisfying!
    Helps move everything into tasks that can be done
        You can see all the goals, and you can see every required task
Use Github Projects to make a progress board
    Useful to keep people on track, track all progress
Trello is another program that can keep progress of projects

Scrum
    Related to teamwork
        Work with crossfunctional team functions
        self-organized teams
    Pillars to scrum
        Transparency
            key elements of projects are visible and understood by those responsible for the outcome.
                Everyone knows what they are doing, and how thier work integrates with everyone else
        Inspection
            Continous checks on the progress torwards a sprint goal
        Adaption
            Change course as soon as undesireable unforseen events take place
    Scrum VALUES
        Commitment
            To achieve every team's goal in every sprint
        Courage
            Work through conflict and challenges together so they can do the right thing
        Focus
            Exclusively on team's goals and the spring backlog
        Openness
            With stakeholders being transparent about work and challenges they face
        Respect
            Each other to be technically capable and working with good intent
    Patterns
        Repeatedly known and proven to work patterns used by other teams and therefore adopted as part of SCRUM model
    Antipatterns:
        Concrete experiences that have disrupted SCRUM patterns in the past and are likely to show up in future
        Document the good and the bad
            All the failed and bad attempts documented
                The experience to getting to this final product
    Artifacts:
        Documentation generated often as result of a pattern

    Scrum Roles
        SCRUM Master
            Typically filled by project manager or team leads
            Removes impediments from scrum team
            Enforces scrum principles
        Scrum team
            Typicaly, 5-10 crossfunctional members
            Members ar full time
            Members can only change teams between sprints
        Product Owner
            Acts like a single voice for the "user"
            Knows what features (not development tasks) need to be built and in what sequence
            Typically, a product manager

    Spring Cycle
        Product owners create product backlog of features that need to be developed, and prioritize backlog based on current needs
        Highest priority tasks are broken down into small deliverable tasks, which are then prioritized by developers and estimated for time
        Tasks are assingned to members that can be completed in the next spring,
            a short period of time where development goals are fixed and cannot be changeed (usually 2 weeks)
        Information and issues shared between members thorugh daily standup meetings
        Each spring, goal and progress are re-assessed and re-prioritzed and new sprint is planned
        After spring review, have a spring retrospective, to review the scrum process
    Spring Planning
        Sprinng Cycle: 2 weeks
        Total work hours/day: 8 hours/day
        Other work hours per day: 4 hour/day
        Actual work hours per day: 8-4 = 4 hour/day
        4 hours/day * 5 days/week * 2 weeks = 40 hours/sprint
        Each team member can support 40 hours worth of work in a sprint
        Scrum team size: 4 members
        5 members * 40 hours/sprint = 200 hours/sprint total team effort

    SCRUM MEETING
        At least every other day
        5-10 minutes
        Status, say progress of tasks
        Required new tasks
        current progress of project
        Make sure everyone is making progress
        You can easily just do this on discord/zoom
