State machines vs finite state machines?
    Part of Turing machines
vacuum tube transistors
talked for half an hour about transistors, and flow of electrons
programming is just the flow of electrons
Talked about Moore's Law, size of transistors

Turing machines can solve any problem
goes left and right in memory
Reads and writes
    Only 4 instructions are required
        LC3 has 15 instructions
    Computerphile, turing machines explained (on YT)

Assignment 1 will just consist of copying code
    Download .zip from canvas/Gradescope
    You can turn it in starting today and Dr Allan Knight will grade them by hand daily
    There is no multiplication instructions, so while loops of adding

This lecture was mostly explaining what will be taught in the class
    / sparking interest about low level computing

===============================================================
Putting electrons to work:

The problem... Words

THe algorithm ...  Words on how to solve problem

THe program... captures algorithm rigorously in specific syntax such as C++, Python

ISA.. Instruction Set Architecture, specifies design parameters as what operations a microprocessor can perform, the memory and bus structures, etc
    A HLL program will be translated to the machine language of the ISA.
    Description of what the processor does

Microarchitecture... Implementation in circuits to interpret the ISA.
    Implementation of the processor
    The way you put logic together in the circuits that can interpret the ISA
        (This is changed every year to be made even slightly more efficient every year by Intel or AMD)

The logic circuits... Implement various componenets of Microarchitecture as assemblies of logic gates

The devices.. logic gates are built from transistors
===============================================================

This class can teach you how to build a processor

n-bits
    2^n distinct values
    bits go up to the power of 2^n, 1bit, 2bit, 4bit, 8bit, 16bit, 32bit, 64bit, 128,256,512,1024,2048...
    1024 = kibi (but people call it kilobytes all the time, kilo = 1000; kibi = 1024)

Pre-fixes for numbers
b - binary
# - decimal
x - hexadecimal
0 - octal (base-8 numbers); we will never use octal

b -> decimal, do the 2^n method
# -> b,
Convert #123 -> binary
#123 / #2 = 1
#61 / 2 = 1
#30 / 2 = 0
#15 /2 = 1
7 / 2 = 1
3/2 = 1
1/2 = 1
0/2 = 0
; if modulo 1, then put a 1

#123 = b1111011

hexadecimal -> used for chars
Only 4 bit chunks, if you see an 8 bit chunk, you just compress it
#16 = x10
b11 = #3
#11 =
x11 =

Signed ints
  b 1011
+ b 0011
  ______
  b 1110
