Quiz is Friday ->
    Maybe Praire test

PC2 will be pushed back aswell

People understand signed magnitude
Every time we see binary
    Assume 2's complement

unsigned ranged
(0, 2^n -1)

Signed range
2^n / 2 = 2^(n-1)

Range(-2^(n-1), 2^(n-1) - 1)

4 bit integers
Range
(0, 15)
signed
(-8,7)
    Out of range errors cause overflow

LC3 stuff
AND R3, R3, #0
    AND anything with 0, it is 0
    #0 are immediate values, stored in an instruction
    AND for the & function
        It does bit math and puts a 1 where they share in common
        Very easy way to set the register to #0
    Loading data from memory less efficient than math

ADD R1, R2, #48
    immediate value is a 5-bit signed integer (Range -16, 15)
