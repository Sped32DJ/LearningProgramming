\section{Make A and B equal. (20 points)}

Given two strings A and B, of length $m$ and $n$, we can defined the distance between the two strings as the number of \textit{insert()}, \textit{delete()}, and \textit{replace()} operations that are performed on A to make it identical to B. 

\noindent\textbf{Your Tasks:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Design a dynamic programming algorithm that returns the minimum number of operations to me A identical to B.
    \item Describe the Size and Dimensionality of the dynamic programming table
    \item Write the recurrence relationship for algorithm in the form
    \[
    dp[i][j] = \begin{cases}
        ...
    \end{cases}
    \]
\end{enumerate}
\noindent\textbf{Technical Note:} Use "\textbackslash begin\{cases\}" to write your recurrence relationship.

\section{The Matrix Chain Multiplication Problem. (20 points)}
Design a \textbf{recursive version} of dynamic programming algorithm (top-down) to construct the actual solution of the matrix chain multiplication problem (i.e., the parentheses order). For this problem, please :
\noindent\textbf{Your Tasks:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write down the recursive function in pseudocode and write down the dynamic table and matrix output on the following examples
\item Show the dynamic programming table and matrix output for 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item  Three matrices (A, B, and C) with dimensions $10 \times 50 \times 5 \times 100$, respectively.
        \item Four matrices (A, B, C, and D) with dimensions $20 \times 5 \times 10 \times 30 \times 10$, respectively.
    \end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\section{The Largest Square Block. (20 points)}
Let A be a $n$ x $m$ matrix of 0's and 1's. \textbf{Design a dynamic programming \textit{O(nm)} time algorithm} for finding the largest square block of A that contains 1's only. When designing the dynamic programming algorithm, please describe the size and dimensionality of the dynamic programming table, and explicitly formulate the recurrence relationship. 

\noindent\textbf{Hint:} Define the dynamic programming table l(i, j) be the length of the side of the largest square block of 1's whose bottom right corner is A[i, j].


\section{RNG (20 points) }

Given $n$ enumerated random number generators each with m possible outputs, numbered from 1 to m, \textbf{design a dynamic programming algorithm} to find the number of ways our random number generators can reach a desired sum $ds$, where $ds$ is the sum of values each generator outputs.

When designing the dynamic programming algorithm, please describe the size and dimensionality of the dynamic programming table, and write the recurrence relationship for algorithm in the form
    \[
    dp[i][j] = \begin{cases}
        ...
    \end{cases}
    \]

\section{Auctioning Server Space (20 points)}

The drug discovery startup is not working out, Michael and Xianghu are starting a business as server hosts -- however there is no seed funding so they're making clients bring their own hardware. They have a single $n$U server rack (a server rack with $n$ standard units of space). They plan to auction off space in the server space as a means of making money. Servers can be any size from 1U to $n$U, but there can only be $k$ servers per rack due to power limitations. Clients will pay based on the size of space they're allocated, which is stored in a a given array $P[1...n]$, $P_i$ denotes the price a client will pay for a $i$ units of server space.

\noindent\textbf{Your Tasks:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Design a dynamic programming algorithm to maximize the amount of money Michael and Xianghu will make.
    \item Give the time complexity of a brute-force solution that does not use dynamic programming or memoization.
    \item Give the time complexity of your dynamic programming implementation
    \item Describe how you could change the algorithm to give the actual divisions to maximize profit
\end{enumerate}


\section{Subset Sum (20 points)  }
Let $A = \left\{a_1 , a_2 ,. . . , a_n \right\}$ and be a set of n positive integer and let \textit{T} be another integer. \textbf{Design a dynamic programming algorithm} that determines whether there exists a \textit{subset of A} whose total sum is \textit{exactly T}. Analyze the time complexity
of your solution.

For instance, if A = \{4, 5, 17, 23, 11, 2\} and T = 35 the algorithm should return True because the subset \{5, 17, 11, 2\} sums to 35. For the same set of numbers if we choose T = 31 the problem has no solution, and the algorithm will return False.

When designing the dynamic programming algorithm, please describe the size and dimensionality of the dynamic programming table, and explicitly formulate the recurrence relationship.
