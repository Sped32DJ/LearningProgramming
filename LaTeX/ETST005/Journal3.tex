For this Journal, I will focus on the week 8 readings with a focus on \textit{Brown} by Nitasha Tamar Sharma
and the reading \textit{Terrorism} by Rajini Srikanth. These readings highlight the connection between
the meaning of words and the historical contexts in which they are used.
In the case of \textit{Brown}, Sharma discusses how the term
to describe people of color has changed over time, particularly in the context of the United States.
Then the reading \textit{Terrorism} by Srikanth discusses the term has originated in the French Revolution and how more recently

"Since 9/11, both the Wars on Terror and the Arab Spring have shifted
yet again the always under-construction lines of "Brown," so that it now
refers to people from the Middle East and North Africa and more broadly to the religion of Islam...
Thus, "Brown" as a reference to a people's phenotype, like "Black," is not merely descriptive or U.S. based - it
is political and global." (Sharma, 19)
