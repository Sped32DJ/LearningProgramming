\section{Citizenship}
Chapter 5
by Helen Heran Jun
\subsection{Foundations of Citizenship}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Citizenship is a legal status that confers rights and privileges.
  \item Citizenship is a social status that confers identity and belonging.
  \item Citizenship grants or denies such rights and duties to
    inhabitants of a state.
  \item All citizenss should have equal standing before 
    the law and are formally equivalent to one another
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Rights such as voting, as they are all treated equally
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Politics of Citizenship}
\begin{itemize}
  \item All citizens participate in an imaginary
    political sphere of equality and formal equivalence.
  \item Political emancipation via citizenhip replaces and displaces
    possibilities for actual emancipation.
  \item Abstract equality is the substance of citizenship
  \item Universalism is designed to offer merely abstract equality.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Marxist Critques}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Critiques on Citizenship as abstract and illusionary
  \item There is a contradiction to citizenship
    that inhere to racialized citizenship.
  \item Racial difference institutionally merges in contradiction
    to the universally promised by political emancipation
    through citizenship.
  \item The classical Marxist critique has not accounted for modalities of
    differentiation as being crucial to the development of capitalism
  \item Asian Americans have never been abstract labor nor abstract citizens

    But, they have been historically formed in contradiction
    to both the economic and the political spheres.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Exclusionist Citizenship for Asian Americans}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Asian American discources had an emphasis on both
    its denial and negation torwardsd Asians.
  \item Asian labor was expoited in the west while those
    same workers were systematically denied citizenship status
  \item Through 1790 Naturalization Act, deemed only "free white persons"
    eligible for naturalized citizenship. Leading to 
    systematic exclusion of new Asian emigrants.
  \item Alien Land laws prohibited Asians already in the US
    from owning property. This included their home and businesses.
  \item Even to those born in the US from immigrants were refered to as
    "alien citizenship", their legal status was often disregarded,
    such as mass internment of Japanese American Citizens.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{History of Exclusionist Citizenships}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Critical to exclude people from citizenship to keep them
    vulnerable and keep them getting exploited for capital.
  \item Reaction to excluding Asian immigrant workers from citizenship
    was a reaction to the formal inclusion of African Americans
    into citizenship in 1868 following the abolition of slavery
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Post WWII \& Civil Rights}
\begin{itemize}
  \item There was a demand for US Labor markets
  \item Civil rights mobilization lead by African Americans
    and others brought an end to exclusionary legislation 
    torwards Asian Americans
  \item Asian Americans incorperated into US Citizenship via
    liberalized immigration policies resulting from 
    Immigration and Naturalization Act, or Hart-Celler Act of 1965.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Post Civil Rights}
\begin{itemize}
  \item All racial groups finally experienced
    full equality in the realm of the law.
  \item Despite all the civil rights progress since 1965,
    the only real progress took place in the
    legal realm of abstract formal equivalence.
  \item legal equivality only enables partial
    socioeconomic mobility for US Racial minorities.
  \item Yet there remains uneven mortality rates,
    unequal access to functioning public education,
    a racialized, gendered labor market, and subject to
    state violence and detention.
  \item Even the middle class and elite Asian Americans
    can still be the basis for a critique of
    citizenship with different political horizons that would be
    transformative of the brutal conditions endured by the 
    racialized poor in this country and beyond.
  \item Citizenship still dictates acccess to labor market
    and to host of state-regulated resources, 
    including housing, healthcare, and education.
\end{itemize}
