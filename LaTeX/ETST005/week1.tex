\section{Race}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Race has been rooted in biology
  \item Phrenology
  \item Justification for enslavement, domination, and colonization
  \item "Master Race"
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Race as a social construct}
\begin{itemize}
  \item People are differenciated by perceived racial features 
  \item often phenotypical factors
  \item This being linguistic and characteristic factors
  \item People typically understand race by phenotypical factors
    \begin{itemize}
      \item eye size
      \item skin color
      \item etc
    \end{itemize}
  \item The definition of "white" has widely changed
    \begin{itemize}
      \item It has even changed to exclude certain people during certain times
      \item Irish people were not considered white for the longest
      \item This was until they were competing with jobs with Black and Asian people,
        therefore they were included that they are not black or not asian
    \end{itemize}
  \item Race is a way to define people
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Even given the "one drop" rule that may even be preserved today 
      \item Even though the one drop white rule does not exist since 
      \item Then there are the people who "pass" as a certain race.
        For people who want to be perceived as a race that they want to. Despite being another
    \end{itemize}
      \item Race being a social construct is present and can even be made real since there are
        laws and various different things that make it very real. 
        Then class being another characteristic we created to be real.
      \item Race is used to help with dominance with people wanting to feel dominant over another
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Racial Formaition}
\begin{itemize}
  \item "The sociohistorical process by which racial categories are created, inhabited, transformed, and destroyed" (109)
  \item Race exists globally and operates differently in different places
  \item Race functions differemtly by law and so on
  \item Even how goods and awards get distributed in a society,
    such as how the Oscars was all given to white people. Entirely
    even when it is debated that other actors arguably did a better job that were not white.
  \item Racialization is the process by which a group of people that get put into a racial group.
    ex: white people are racialized into white. Then how
    Irish people were racialized into white.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Racial Projects}
\begin{itemize}
  \item "A racial project is simultanously an interpreatation, representation, or explanation..."
  \item Project: Policy, social practice, interactions
  \item Reoganization how race operates and is understood
  \item Accumulates over time
  \item "Common sense"
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The racial common sense and what race means
      \item What becomes normalized as the racial difference
      \item The racial logics understood by the people and the law
    \end{itemize}
  \item Desegragation is even a racial project, as a way
    race operates.
    Stop using race to segregate people by the color of their skin
  \item Getting rid of Jim Crow was a racial project, but there were 
    still signs of racism. It did not go away
  \item Racial Projects build upon old ones, helps change political and cultural currents
  \item Affirmative Action:
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Affirmative Action}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Policies using race and other social categories to include people sociohistorically 
    discriminating against
  \item They believed that Hardvard was not race blind and was doing race based admissions
  \item Believe it violates the 14th amendment
  \item Race being a determining factor for who gets into jobs and these prestigious institutions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Pair Share}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Make America Great Again
  \item Mass deportations are part of the cause to bring down other races in order to bring up the "white race"
  \item We can easily talk about tarriffs, in reality this is an attack to China and how America is afraid of China.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Racism}
\begin{itemize}
  \item "The state sanctioned and/or extraglegal production and exploitation of group 
    differentiatted vulnerabilities to premature death, in distrinctly yet 
    densely interconnecteed political geographies."
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Interpersonal Acts of Racism}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Microaggressions
\begin{itemize}
  \item Confusing two people of the same race since "they look the same"
\end{itemize}

\item Individual prejudice 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Crossing the street beacuse a black person was on your side of the street
    \item Not hiring someone of a race since they may not be the fit or violent
  \end{itemize}

\item intentional or unintentional
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Intention doesn't really matter
    \item It was still done
  \end{itemize}
\item Perpetuate and remake ideas of race
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Structural/Systemic Racism}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Society-wide level
  \item "systems" not individuals
  \item Part of culture, practices, ideas
  \item When pain is not acknowledged for certain races
  \item Then how black women more often miscarry since they don't believe their pain or complications and underplay their real concenrns
  \item Anything that helps us to learn to be racist,
    Books that are racist and show ideas about racism
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Race and Class}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Race and class are intimately connected
  \item Someone's race shapes the way that the person will have economic oppurtunities 
    and acceses to capital
  \item Race is not a product of class, nor vice-versa
  \item Peolpe of racial privaledge do experience class differently
  \item "Race is...the modality in which class is 'lived' [vice-versa], the medium through which class relations..."
\end{itemize}

\section{Intesectionality}

\subsection{Problems with Intersectionality}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The different genders experience their race differently
  \item Such as how black women were given the right to vote way before black men were given the right to vote and so on.
  \item "Many women of color feel obliged [to choose] between ethnicity and womanhood: how can they?
    You never have/are one withut the other. The idea of two ollusorily seperated identities, one ethnic, the other women (or more preceisely female),..."
  \item Origin:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Sojouner Truth, 1851: 
        "Ain't I a Woman?"
      \item African American women about not having the rights of as the cis white woman
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\pagebreak

\subsection{Intersectionality}

\begin{itemize}
  \item "Something one does rather than something one is"
  \item How the law only protected white women's chastity.
    Then how rape was only established against white women. 
    Black women were deemed as "unchased" therefore they had no legal protection against rape.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Oppresion Olympics}
\begin{itemize}
  \item People "compete" for being the most oppresseed to show 
    that their cocenrns are the most important
    or that they suffer the most intersectional forms of oppression
  \item Forms of oppression are historically 
    and geographically specific, 
  \item but they operate under common, 
    interconnected systems of oppression
    (white supremacy, capitalism, heteropatriachial)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Pair Share Political Stakes of intersectionality}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The political Statkes of intersectionality in the current moment?
  \item The political stakes can be how Trump has put various of supreme court justicies, all that think alike him.
  \item These were the people that took on many important cases such as rights for female autonomy.
  \item The wrong people are representing the entirety of America, it should be more 
    diverse since we have majority old white conservative men
\end{itemize}
