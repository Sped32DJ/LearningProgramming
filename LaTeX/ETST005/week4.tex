\subsection{Pair Share - What are the stakes of eliminating birthright citizenship?}
\begin{itemize}
  \item It will keep the cycle of racism keep going since now
    it is up to the state to decide who is here "legally" and "illegally"
  \item Now it becomes political betweeen who is allowed in and who isn't
    There may be prioritization between some races and exclusion for others
  \item There is potential for deportation of entire families,
    including children of immigrants who never learned the language.
    Now we would have Americans outside of their homes living in new countries.

\subsection{Types of citizenship}
\begin{itemize}
  \item citizenship when it comes
    \begin{enumerate}

      \item rights
      \item political activity
      \item identity (cultural citizenship)
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Equality when it comes to legal rights 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Problems with citizenship}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Blood and soil
  \item Used by the Nazi and 3rd reich, the Aryan blood is

    pure and part of their manifest destiny to rule their "rightfull" land.
  \item citizenship works as designed
  \item Not all people are equal
  \item citizenship is racist and sexist
  \item citizenship does not protext people from exploitation
  \item Stateless people

  \item It purposely excludes the people who do not "belong" to the nation
  \item Those people who are born in indegenous land, are not naturally American citizens
    and rather citizens to that tribe. Giving them the name of stateless people.
  \item This is part of the act of displacing and erasing indegenous people
  \item Socioeconomic and policing along with the job market will be different between
    American Citizens. Especially if extreme policing has caused felonies to the
    wrong people.
  \item Gender and race used to exclude who can vote, then were treated differently.
  \item Refugees are often stateless people, they do not have access to any 
    government resources and are not protected at all by the law
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Investments in Institutions of the Nation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Patriotism and Nationalism

    Blind loyalty and upholds the nation state
  \item Liberal citizenship
  \item ideal citizens

    This is for those who are citizens as it is the ultamite
    right. Since it is the defining factor for who is given justice.

    Supposed to be good working, not depending on the state and do their job correctly.
    Must not question the power of the state and vote when given a ballot.

  \item empire

    Decides who can be included in the exclusion of non-citizens

  \item Used to reinforce the ideals of the US along with
    excluding those who are not part of this image.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What are the alternatives?}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Maintain a strong critique torwards the nation-state

    You can't let the government become an imperial regime
  \item Critiquing rights-based discourses
  \item Disidentify with nation-state and territoriality.

    Problematic since these some protected rights can just be taken away.
    Granted by nation states that can easily just say it doesn't apply
    to non-citizens
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Abolition and Citizenship}
\begin{itemize}
  \item WED Du Bois - Black Reconstruction in America (1935)
  \item Abolition democracy
  \item Radically democratic notion of citizenship free of racism,
    capitalism, and white supremacy
  \item Building new Institutions, laws, and many more for the
    abolition of slaves.
  \item Discussed about the eventual encorperation to African Americans
    into the American civilization.
  \item Rich people just acted upon capital
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Abolish citizenship}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Tear down and build up
  \item Abolish borders and/or nations, and allow free movement

    There is a great involvement with police when it comes to this
  \item Balibar: membership based on residence with freedom of movement

    Freedom of movement of how demolishing borders. Let everyone
    be one. Especially globally. You can achieve global citizenship
  \item Equality regardless of background
  \item Grand localities sovereignty and self-determination
  \item Full reparations
\end{itemize}

\section*{Free Write}
What do you think the future of citizenship holds? How
do you see this impacting Asians in America?

In the current political state, it seems as if more exclusionary acts
will be done against people that are migrating into the state.
Let alone the amount of tarifs that we are making against China,
that racism translates over to the rest of Asia since China since
Americans put them all under the same bubble.

Given that racism has never stopped existing, I do not have much hope for the future
and how there will be true social equality for all migrants. I believe
that now with our advanced society where we can circumnavigate the world
in less than a day, it not be too restrictive.

Given the agreements our president has done with other nations in order
to exclude people of other nations from entering, this is not a good
sign and looks like we will be taking a step back in the future.

I believe that there will be more social racism against Asian Americans,
especially since the US is starting a trade war with Tariffs all over
pure political discourse. It only takes so long until these items
being restricted over the border starts becoming people, and they
start excluding even the people who are citizens. It is a thin line that is 
quite easily crossed.

It will definitely be harder to get citizenship in the future given the current political
sphere.

This discussion will be forever discussed with no resolution or plan to calm down.
It is a tale as long as the US has existed, and it will not be resolved.
The people want something that is fair, then the politicians want something
to keep them in power.
