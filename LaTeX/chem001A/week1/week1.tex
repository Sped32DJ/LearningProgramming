\subsection{Classifications of matter}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Physical form of matter is composed by state and composition
\end{itemize}

States:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Solid
  \item Liquid: incompressible
  \item Gas
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Different substances corresponding to different arrangements of atoms
  \item Different arrangements of atoms make completely different things
\end{itemize}

\bf{Bonds}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Chemical bonds are what holds bonds together
\end{itemize}

\bf{Classifications of matter}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Pure substance: constant composition
  \item All speciments of this same substance has the same makeup and properties
  \item Elements can't be broken down into simpler substances
  \item Pure substance are either an element or a compound
  \item Compounds can be broken down into simpler substances
\end{itemize}

\bf{Mixtures}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Mixtures are composed of two or more types of matter that can be present or varying.
  \item Two classes of mixtures, heterogeneous and homogeneous
  \item Hetero mix: variable composition
  \item Homo mix: (also called solution) has a uniform composition
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Physical vs chemical changes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Chemical changes change chemical properties such as
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Reactivity
      \item Flammability
      \item Corrosive
    \end{itemize}
  \item Chemical Changes
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{SI Unit stuff...}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Density
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Density = $\frac{mass}{volume} $
      \item Density is an intensive property, independent of the amount of substance we have
      \item Ratio of two extensive properties, it becomes intensive
      \item Density is constant(intensive), mass and volume is variable(extensive)
    \end{itemize}
  \item When we are writing digits, the last digit is not very certain, but the two digits in front
    are certain. 4.57, the 4.5 is certain, then 0.07 is not very certain.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Ex: Calculating the miniscus, you can add what ever sounds right for the last digit,
        they are within margin of error
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Fri lecture: 10/3}
\begin{itemize}
  \item I was told this is all unit conversion...
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reliability Measurements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Last figure is estimated, all before are certain
  \item Exact numbers, have no uncertainty.

    Applies to discrete objects, you can imagine, 3.0000... atoms when 3 atoms and present
\end{itemize}
