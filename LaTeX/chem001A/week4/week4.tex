\subsection{Emissions Spectra and the Bohr Model}
\begin{itemize}
  \item We are now struggling with the emission spectrum of atoms to solve that question
  \item Every atom or molecule has a discrete emission spectrum
  \item They are unique to each atom, treat them as a bar code
  \item Then Rydberg Equation developed a formula to predict the emission spectrum of atomic hydrogen:
    $$\frac{1}{\lambda{}} = R (\frac{1 }{n^2_1} - \frac{1}{n^2_2}) $$
  \item Including Rydberg's constant to make it make sense
  \item Postulate Bohr model to figure out the spectrum model
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Called hydrogen atoms to only allow certain energy levels,
    called \textbf{stationary states}.
  \item Atom does not radiate energy while in a stationary state. (violation of classical physics)
  \item Atom changes to another stationary state (another orbit) only by obsorbing
    or emitting a photon. Energy of photon (hv)...
\end{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
  \item There is something about how atoms absorb photon to increase in energy level
  \item When they emit the photon, they decrease a level of energy (as observed in emission spectrum)
  \item Assuming this is actually happens, you can explain the emission spectrum, hence, why it is a postulate
  \item The energy level can be calculated as
    $$ E = const (\frac{1}{n^2_{final}} - \frac{1}{n^2_{init}}) $$
  \item Looks a lot like Rydberg's equation
    $$ \Delta{}E = E_{final} - E_{init} $$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations of Bohr Model}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Only predicts transition energyies for atoms
    $$ E = -2.18\times{}10^{-18} J \frac{Z}{n^2} $$
  \item This model requires quantum mechanics to fully understand the gaps
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Quant descryption of hydrogen}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Going from Bohr model of "Orbits"
    \rightarrow{} Quantum model of "Orbitals"
  \item F = ma = m $\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$, "position function" x(t)

    This is a differential equation (I mean, both of them are).
    This  is a time domain
  \item Wave Function, \Psi{}. H$\psi{} = E\psi{} $

    This is a frequency domain
  \item When it comes to these, there is an infinite number of solutions
  \item Orbitals can be identifies using combination of three integers called quantum numbers
  \item Ech orbital has a methamtically defined shape
  \item Each orbital has a probabilistic "location"(?)
  \item $n$ = Principle Quantum Number

    n = 1, 2,3, .., $\inf{}$
  \item $L$ = Angular Momentum quantum number

    L = 0,,1,2,...,n-1
  \item $m_I$ = Magnetic Quantum Number
    -l, -l, + 1, ..., 0, ..., l - 1, l
  \item Go to office hours to solve these differential equations
  \item When it comes for the \# of orbitals, 2l + 1 = \# of orbitals
  \item l = n-1, 0, -l, +l
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Terms and definitions for QUant}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Shell}: Given value of principle quantum number $n$. There are $\inf{} $ \# of shells labelled $n$ = 1,2,..,$\inf{}$
  \item \textbf{Subshell:} each shell divided into subshells, determined by angular momentum quantum number $l$.
    For given shell with principle quantum number $n$, there are $n-1$ different subshells.
    Associated with each subshell is a letter designation.
\end{itemize}

    \begin{tabular}{ccc}
        \textbf{(n, l, m$_I$)} & \textbf{Orbital Name} & \textbf{\# of orbitals} \\
        \hline
        (2,0,m$_I$) & 2s & 1 \\
        (2,1,m$_I$) & 2p & 3 \\
        (4,2,m$_I$) & 4d & 5 \\
        (4,3,1) & 4f & 1 \\
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Orbital Information}
\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Electrons go down, orbitals are in a square
  \item Electrons have some mass, they have a charge
  \item Electrons also have a spin
  \item We had no idea where mass came from until a few years ago.

    Mass comes from the large hydron collider, and with sufficient energy.
    We get the Higgs field (Higgs boson). Particles interacting with the Higgs field makes mass.
  \item Spin exists, and use these properties to figure out how to put electrons into orbitals
\end{itemize}

\section{Wednesday: Oct 22$^{th}$}
\subsection{Orbitals and electrons}
\begin{itemize}
  \item You can fit electrons in an orbital, this is within the probabilistic approach of where
    electrons would likely to be
  \item Electrons have a spin up (or a spin down; depending who you ask)
  \item Electron homes are called Shells
  \item Following derived from Shroder equation
    $$ H \Psi{}  = (Energy) E \Psi{} (orbital) $$
  \item E = $\frac{1}{n^2} $, as n increases, so does energy
  \item One S-orbital 1, 1 = $1^2 $
  \item One S-orbital and three P-orbitals 4 \rightarrow{} 1+3 = 2$^2$
  \item 3x3 shell, one s-orbital, three p-orbitals, five d-orbitals, seven f-orbitals = 16

    \rightarrow{} 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = $4^2$
  \item Bohr's equation
    $$E = (\frac{1}{n_f^2} - \frac{1}{n_i^2}) $$
    There must be stationary states and we use that to define the energy states present. Until there is a transition
    between these states. As in, referring to shells (??)

    Used to describe the electron
  \item Quantum mechanics gives us the reason why Rydberg and Bohr models work out.
    They both bring in an integer, meanwhile Quantum helps solve for these constants
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Shape of Hydrogen Orbitals}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Finish below later, something about the hydrogen orbital shape calculation
  \item $${}_{\psi{}_n,l,m_I}(r, \theta{}, \phi{}) = NR_{n,l} (r) P_I $$
  \item P-orbitals, $p_z$, $p_x$ = m$_e$ = -1, $p_y$. Orientation is different based upon the cartesian coordinate system
  \item d-orbitals, look quite weird, flower shaped
  \item Should be able to identify the differences
  \item f-orbitals get even more intense, even weirdly shaped, more lobes
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What does $\psi{}$ tell us}
\begin{itemize}
  \item This is all probabilistic
  \item Apple tree analogy
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Map the apples fallen from an apple tree as a shell, then see the relationship of these apples
      \item You will see most of them fall a bit away from the trunk, and less from the outside
      \item Counting the number of apples within each circle
      \item We get a distribution, a graph, in n apples per shell of trunk
    \end{itemize}
  $$\psi{}^2 = probability Density  = \frac{probability}{unit Volume} $$
\item Nodes are very specifically wave phenomnon,
  There are shells of very probability with wavelight behavior.
\item As we go from 2s to 3s, we (s-1) roots where we hit zero, then end asymptotically zero
\item p-orbitals \rightarrow{}  dumbbells
\item d-orbitals \rightarrow{} clover leafs
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Aufbau Principle:} Place electrons in the orbital with the lower  possible energy
  \item \textbf{Pauli Exclusion Principle:} Only one electron is allowed per quantum state i.e. two spin-paired electrons per orbitals
  \item \textbf{Hund's Rule:} Place electrons in separate degenerate (same energy levels) orbitals before pairing
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Putting electrons into orbitals}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Solutions are all approximated after Hydrogen
\end{itemize}
