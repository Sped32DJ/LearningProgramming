Combinational vs Sequential logic

Combinational
    Output is pure function of its current inputs
    Output doesn't change regardless how many times the logic is triggered.
    Static, every day, you expect the exact same input and behavior
        Almost as if it had no memory
    Implementation is boolean algebra
Sequential
    Output depends on current and the previous sequence of inputs
    Dynamic
        Maybe something like rolling keys, new input, same output
        ~There is memory remembering
        There is a current state and there is a next state.
            Once the current state triggers Combinational logic
            It then goes to the next state, this next state interracts with memory element
            After interraction, next state becomes current state, then the cycle continues
    Implementation is finite state machines

Boolean Algebra
    3 fundamental logic operations: AND, OR, and NOT
    Which abstract algebra with set operations: intersection, union, complement

Truth Tables
    Used to represent relationship between inputs and outputs
    Gray codes: 00, 01, 10, 11
    NAND - !(ab)        (Not AND; AND complement)       (gray code: 1110)
    NOR - !(a+b)        (Not OR; OR complement)         (gray code: 1000)
    XOR - (a+b)(!a + !b) or (a !b) + (!a b) or (symmetrical difference between a and b)     (odd operator) (gray code: 0110)
        Exclusive-OR (Ex-OR for abbreviation)
        - Returns 1 if there is an odd number of variables that are 1s otherwise returns 0
    XNOR - ab + !a !b   (concurrence operator) (gray code: 1001)
        Exclusive-NOR (Ex-NOR for abbreviation)
        - Returns 1 if there is an even nunmber of variables that are 1s otherwise returns 0

AND gate (*)
    0 0 = 0
    0 1 = 0
    1 0 = 0
    1 1 = 1
OR gate (+)

NAND and NOR are universal gates
    you can build any circuit with everything NAND or NOR
    Simplifies design as you ojnly need one type of gate
    NANDO only neeeds 4 transistors - gate delay is smaller than OR/AND that needs 6 transistors.
    NAND is slightly faster than NOR due to the physics nature
