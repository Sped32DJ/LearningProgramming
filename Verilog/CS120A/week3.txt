For midterm:
    Study combination and know some sequential logic.
    Understand what they mean and what they are
    Week 7: midterm
    NAND gates are cheaper and faster than NOR gates
Definitions of Boolean Function Expressions:
    Complement: variable with a bar over it or a ` - A`, !B, C_ (top bar)
    Literal: Variable or its complement - A, !A, B, !B, C, !C
    Implicant (Product term): product of literals - ABC, AC, BC
    Implicate (sum terms): sum of literals - (A+B+C), (A+C), (B+C)
    Minterm: AND that includes all input variables - ABC, !A BC, AB !C
    Maxterm: OR that includes all input variables -

XNOR - When both bits are the same
