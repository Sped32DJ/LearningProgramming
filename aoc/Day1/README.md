## Solution
# Why did I use bash, vim, python for this?
* idk how to code lol
# how did you get a solution?
* curl https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1/input >> input.txt
vim, recorded macro (editing input.txt)
: 0j bckspc +
$ sed 's/++/\n/g' test.txt >> workable.py
: This only works because there is double ++ for every white space XD

---
* 0i print ( esc A ) esc 0 j i
> python3 workable.txt >> numbers.py
* 0ji esc bckspc , space
* Then, I wrote real code in numbers.py, and got my solution after running it!
