first column
# Rock  = "A"
# Paper = "B"
# Scssr = "C"
second column
# Rock  = "X"
# Paper = "Y"
# Scssr = "Z"

wait, it's more complex than that
ex:
    A Y
    B X
    C Z

Honestly, bash this lol.
sed, and vim macros

Make 3 versions of the output
1.Paper + Rock = positive # Paper win
2.Rock + scsrs = positive # Rock win
3.scsr + Paper = positive # scissors win

Combinations:
A X: 55  (tie)
A Y: 401 (Rock L)
A Z: 223 (Rock W)

B X: 252 (Paper L)
B Y: 275 (tie)
B Z: 134 (Paper W)

C X: 188 (scissors L)
C Y: 373 (scissors W)
C Z: 599 (tie)

How did I find the combinations?
    rg -i (A, B, C)(X, Y, Z) input.txt | wc --lines # Make this real, especially the part where it multiplies the combinations
# Please don't laugh :sob:
